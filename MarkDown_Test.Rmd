```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment="")
```


## This is a random table

This is a test.

<!-- cache=T runs this chunk the first time, but does not run it again -->

```{r sleep, echo=F, cache=T} 
xx <- data.frame(x=1:10, y=rnorm(10,1,1))
knitr::kable(xx)
x <- 1
for(i in 1:10){
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}
```

## This is a random figure

```{r}
plot(xx$x, xx$y)
```

## This is an equation

$$ 
x=y+z
$$

## This is a calculation

```{r, dependson="sleep", results='hide'}
y<-5
z<-1
print(x)
```

The value of x is `r x`.
